# Landing & Checkout Launch Workspace

This repository hosts the marketing experience for the training and nutrition launch. It follows the
architecture documented in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and ships in phases described in
[`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_TODO.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_TODO.md).

## Current Status (Phase 1)
- Next.js App Router project scaffolded with TypeScript support.
- Tailwind CSS configured with project-wide defaults.
- Contentlayer integration stubbed to unblock MDX-driven workflows.
- Foundational directories, routes, and UI component placeholders created.
- Linting (`npm run lint`) and type checking (`npm run typecheck`) scripts configured for future CI usage.

Subsequent phases will bring in MDX content contracts, fully designed sections, ESP integrations, analytics, and
launch readiness tasks.
